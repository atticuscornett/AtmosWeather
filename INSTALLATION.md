# Installation Help

### Windows
- Download the Windows installer. (.exe)
- Run the Windows installer.
- If Windows SmartScreen prevents you from running the file, click on "More info" and then "Run anyways".
- After the installer finishes, Atmos Weather begins running in the background and can be opened with the new desktop icon.
- At this time, the Windows installer is only available for x64-based processors (AMD and Intel machines).
- Atmos Weather will automatically update when new versions are released.

### Android
- Download the Android installer. (.apk)
- Run the Android installer using your preferred file manager.
- If you get a prompt saying that you cannot install apps from this source, tap on the settings option and enable installing from your file manager.
- Select install.
- After the installer finishes, open Atmos Weather. It will begin running in the background even after you close it.
- Atmos Weather does not automatically update on Android, but can be updated manually by downloading and running the latest APK. This will update the app and keep your settings and data.
- IMPORTANT: Some Android devices (especially those from Samsung) may try to limit Atmos Weather's background abilities. Make sure that you check your settings and allow background battery usage or else notifications may not work properly.

### Linux
- Download the Linux installer that is appropriate for your CPU architecture. (.deb)
  - At this time, pre-built Linux versions are only available for Debian-based Linux distros, including Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Raspberry Pi OS, and many more.
  - Linux builds support the following architectures: x64 (AMD and Intel), ARM64 (modern 64-bit ARM processors, like on some Chromebooks), and ARMv7l (32-bit ARM processors, like on most Raspberry Pi models.)
- Run the Linux installer.
- If prompted or if the option is available in the menu, select install.
- You may be prompted to enter your user account password to install the untrusted software.
- After the installer runs, Atmos Weather should appear in your program list.
  - If your apps are sorted into categories, Atmos Weather should be found under "Utilities." Some distros may call it "Accessories" instead.
  - Atmos Weather may show with a default blank app logo. This is a bug that we plan to fix in future releases.
- Atmos Weather does not run automatically after installation. Launch Atmos Weather to start the background task. Launching again will open the GUI.
- Atmos Weather does not automatically run on startup on Linux. This is a bug that we plan to fix in future releases.

### Mac
- Download the Mac installer that is appropriate for your CPU architecture.
  - If you have an Apple Silicon device (M1 or M2 chip), download the silicon/arm64 version.
  - If you have an Intel device (i3, i5, i7, etc.), download the x64 version.
